   <h2> The Dark &amp; True History of Bananas </h2>
   <p class="funParagraph">
      The history of the banana industry has some dark origins, particulary in the terms of labor exploitation and
      political influence. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the United Fruit Company (now known as
      Chiquita Brands International) became one of the largest and most powerful corporations in the world. United Fruit
      played a major role in the development of the banana industry in Latin America, particularly in countries like
      Honduras, Guatemala, and Colombia. </p>

   <p>"Although bananas may only look like a fruit, they represent a wide variety of environmental, economic, social,
      and political problems. The banana trade symbolizes economic imperialism, injustices in the global trade market,
      and the globalization of the agricultural economy. Bananas are also number four on the list of staple crops in the
      world and one of the biggest profit makers in supermarkets, making them critical for economic and global food
      security. As one of the first tropical fruits to be exported, bananas were a cheap way to bring the tropics to
      North America and Europe. Bananas have become such a common, inexpensive grocery item that we often forget where
      they come from and how they got here." <br> &nbsp; <br> - Rebecca Cohen, Global Issues for Breakfast: The Banana
      Industry and its Problems, The Science Creative Quarterly, Issue 3, September 07 - April 08 </p>
   <h3> Bananas Are Serious Business </h3>
   <p>United Fruit gained immense political power and often used it to protect its business interests. For example, the
      company was known for using its influence to manipulate governments in Latin America and the Caribbean, often
      supporting military coups and other undemocratic regimes to maintain its control over the banana trade. At the
      same time, United Fruit and other companies in the banana industry often relied on cheap and exploitative labor
      practices. Workers in banana plantations were frequently exposed to dangerous pesticides and were paid very low
      wages. Many workers also faced harsh working conditions and were denied basic labor rights. In response to these
      practices, labor movements and activist groups have fought for better conditions for banana workers for many
      decades. Some of these efforts have led to improvements in worker rights and environmental protections, but many
      challenges remain. Today, the banana industry is still dominated by a few large corporations, and many of the
      challenges faced by workers and farmers in the past continue to be present today. However, there are also efforts
      underway to promote more sustainable and equitable practices in the banana industry, such as fair trade
      certifications and other sustainability initiatives.</p>
